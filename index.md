# Aim and Scope

With each passing day, we are witnessing an increased integration of intelligent machines in our daily lives such as self-driving cars, Intelligent Assistive Systems (IAS), and companion robots. The omnipresence of such intelligent machines poses certain ethical and legal challenges. To ensure the beneficence of autonomous agents towards humans (and other machines), we need to introduce ethical and legal mechanism(s) to govern and align actions executed by AI-based algorithms according to our societal ethical and moral norms. The challenge of encoding our ethical preferences into machines is two-fold: Technical and Philosophical. Regarding the former, various frameworks have been already proposed to realise operationalisable ethics. These frameworks can be roughly divided into three categories: 1) Probabilistic approaches 2) Learning-Based approaches 3) Logic-Based approaches. Regarding the latter, there are also ethical challenges to consider. Some dispute that machines cannot act ethically at all, since this presupposes the possibility of reflection and justification. Regardless of this objection, there is by no means agreement among ethicists about which ethical principles should be implemented and in which hierarchical relationship they should stand to each other. In light of the fact that the systems that might even get into the situation of having to make an ethically relevant decision on their own have yet to be developed, the debate on implementing ethical principles in AI systems is still in its infancy. A first step towards solving the problems mentioned is therefore to bring the relevant experts into discussion with each other.

The aim of the workshop is therefore primarily to initiate an interdisciplinary dialogue between the individual disciplines, such that the state of research of the respective discipline can be understood by the participants and conceptual ambiguities, which exist especially in interdisciplinary projects, can be cleared up. As organizers, we hope that our workshop will help to establish a platform for interdisciplinary collaboration and will pave the way to find a common ground among these disciplines such that a roadmap towards ethics aware Artificial Intelligence can be proposed.

# Call for papers and abstracts

With the emergence and proliferation of smart machines in professional and everyday contexts, ethical and legal issues are particularly salient. Integrating ethical principles is challenging from both a technical and philosophical perspective. The goal of the workshop is therefore to bring together contributions from computer science, engineering, philosophy, and other relevant fields that tackle these challenges and address the following topics (not limmited to):

- Ethics-aware and responsible AI development
- Ethical Decision Framework(s) in different application domains
	- Intelligent Assistive Systems
	- Self-Driving Cars
	- Healthcare
	- Robotics
	- Other decision-making frameworks
- Technical Approaches towards operationalising ethics in AI
	- Probablisitc Approaches
	- Logic Based Approaches
	- Learning Based Approaches
	- Other approaches
- Validation approaches for an ethical decision framework

The above list is not an exhaustive list but only an indicative one. We solicit either full papers (LNCS format, maximum12 pages) or extended abstract (of 700-1000 words) in which you present your project, your research question, your methods and, if applicable, your initial results. All papers and abstracts must be written in English and are to be submitted via the [Easychair submission website](https://www.easychair.org/my/conference?conf=aithics2021) until 8 August 2021. Accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published in CEUR Workshop Proceedings. Authors of accepted contributions will be invited to present their work during the workshop. Since the goal of the workshop is especially to guide an exchange between disciplines, we highly encourage interdisciplinary teams to submit.
